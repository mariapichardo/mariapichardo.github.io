  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <h3>Overview</h3>

<p>For our second project, we analized a dataset containing the Billboard Top 100 songs for the year 2000.</p>
<p>The dataset has the following columns: Artist, track name, genre, weekly positions on Top 100 for the next 76 weeks after date entering, date entered and date peaked.</p>
<h3>My selected Hypothesis</h3>

<p>"The tracks that reach the peak faster, stay as numbeer ones longer".</p>
<p>Basically I want to study the relationship between the time a track takes to reach the position number one and the time that it will stay there. This will describe to me what genre/artist are the most popular and I would say the most profitable - but do not have data to proof the last statement. </p>
<p>This can help the industry to know where they have to invest the most money to continue being one of the most profitable indusries in the world.</p>
<p>"The American music industry generated 15 billion U.S. dollars in 2012, making up 30 percent of the total 50 billion U.S. dollars generated by the global music industry. "   <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1639/music/"> According to documented Statistics &amp; Facts</a></p>
<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p>We assumed the data is reliable and accurate.</p>
<h3>Risks  and Assumptions</h3>

<p>We only have the year 2000, the population might not represent the most accurate behavior, we would need at least 5 to 10 years to be more precise. </p>
<p>Noticed on my EDA that results are biased by the number of tracks that get into the billboard in some categories. Below a table that shows number of tracks on the top 100 by genre for the year 2000.</p>

<h3>Findings and Visuals</h3>

<p>Most of my analysis was done by GENRE.</p>
<p>Below tables and graphics that illustrated the behavior by GENRE in terms of how many weeks they took to reach peak, how long they stayed as number one and how many weeks they stayed on the top 100.</p>
<p><img src="./images/pr02_genre_table.jpg" alt="Logo" title="DSI" /> </p>
<p>We can see below that the GENRE that took less to reach the top was "Jazz"  but there is only one jazz song, it does not represent the behavior of the population, however the most songs are under GENRE "Rock" that I realized is "Soft Rock" . Rock is definetely the favorite genre and we can see the behavior in these graphics. It is followed by Rock'm roll and Lati Music.</p>

<p>Another set of data that caught my attention was who were the top artists. You can see in the information below that Santana was the most popular followed by Destiny's Child.  </p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>We ran our descriptive stats on 3 variables: The number of weeks for a track to get to peak, the nuber of weeks it stays on number one and the number of weeks the tracks stay on the the top 100. we can see that this last one is distributed more normally and the first two are skewed to the right.</p>
<p>As per this analysis of the Billboard year 2000 dataset we can confirm our Hypothesis that the tracks that reach the top faster stays there.</p>
<p>We have acquired more knowledge in this week03 that will allow me to do a more technical and in depth statistical inference that I will apply next week. </p>
