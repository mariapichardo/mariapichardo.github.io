<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This week we worked with remote databases, and more advanced topics for conducting logistic regression.</p>
<p>We are going to create, train and evaluate a logistic regression model for disaster analysis using AWS PostgreSQL instance via Python.</p>
<p>In this project, we'll be using data on passengers from the 1912 Titanic disaster stored in a remote PostgreSQL database to create our model. Our purpose is to explain, using regression analysis, the impact of sex, passenger class, and age on a person’s likelihood of surviving the shipwreck.</p>
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>A research firm that specializes in emergency management needs to create and train a logistic regression model that can show off the firm's capabilities in disaster analysis. The model will predict WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO SURVIVE when a disaster comes up. </p>
<h3>Project Goals</h3>

<p>The main goals for this project are:
<ul>
<li>Collect your data from an AWS PostgreSQL instance via Python + Jupyter Notebook.</li>
<li>Perform any necessary data wrangling before building the model </li>
<li>Create a logistic regression model to figure out the likelihood of a passenger's survival </li>
<li>Gridsearch optimal parameters for the logistic regression model </li>
<li>Create a kNN model and optimize its parameters with gridsearch</li>
<li>Examine and explain the confusion matrices and ROC curves </li>
<li>Create a report of your findings and detail the accuracy and assumptions of your model </li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Dataset Background</h3>

<p>On April 14, 1912, the unthinkable happened when the “unsinkable” RMS Titanic crashed into an iceberg and sunk into the Atlantic Ocean. The 20 lifeboats aboard the ship, a number actually larger than that required by the British Board of Trade at the time, were not enough to save a majority of the passengers, leaving over 1500 passengers aboard the sinking vessel. A total of 705 passengers escaped onto lifeboats and to safety. But not all passengers had an equal chance of getting onto a lifeboat and surviving the disaster.</p>
<h3>Dataset Description</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mariapichardo/GA-DSI/blob/master/projects/projects-weekly/project-05/titanic.csv"> 
<font color="1dcaff">This Titanic dataset</font> </a> describes the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. It does not contain information for the crew, but it does contain actual and estimated ages for almost 80% of the passengers.</p>
<p>SIZE:891 Passengers, 12 Variables
SOURCES:</p>
<p><b><u>VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS</u></b>
<ul>
<li><b>PassengerId </b>  Body Identification Number</li>
<li><b>Survived </b> (0 = No; 1 = Yes)</li>
<li><b>Pclass</b>  Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd) </li>
<li><b>Name</b></li>
<li><b>Sex</b></li>
<li><b>Age</b></li>
<li><b>SibSp</b> Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard</li>
<li><b>Parch</b> Number of Parents/Children Aboard</li>
<li><b>Ticket</b> Ticket Number</li>
<li><b>fare </b> Passenger Fare (British pound)</li>
<li><b>Cabin</b> cabin’s location</li>
<li><b>embarked</b> Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton) Lifeboat</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b><u>SPECIAL NOTES</u></b>
<ul>
<li><b>Pclass</b> is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES) 1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower</li>
<li><b>Age</b> is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1) If the Age is estimated, it is in the form xx.5</li>
<li><b>Fare</b> is in Pre-1970 British Pounds ()- Conversion Factors: 1 = 12s = 240d and 1s = 20d</li>
</ul>
<hr size="14" noshade>
<p>With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch) some relations were ignored. The following are the definitions used for sibsp and parch.</p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sibling:</b> Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard Titanic</li>
<li><b>Spouse:</b> Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses and Fiances Ignored)</li>
<li><b>Parent:</b> Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard Titanic</li>
<li><b>Child:</b> Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger Aboard Titanic</li>
</ul>

<p>Other family relatives excluded from this study include cousins, nephews/nieces, aunts/uncles, and in-laws. Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them. As well, some travelled with very close friends or neighbors in a village, however, the definitions do not support such relations.</p>

<hr size="14" noshade>

<h3>Data Mining</h3>

<p>We replaced the null ages with the median, because 20% of the dataset has null ages.
We removed the null records for Embarked, consider them not meaningful </p>
<h3>Findings</h3>

<p> The Median Ages is 28 </p>

<p> The oldest person was 80 </p>

<p><img src="./images/age_dist.png" alt="Embarked Proportion" title="Findings" /></p>
<p> The average fare was 34 pounds</p>

<p><img src="./images/multiple_pie.png" alt="Embarked Proportion" title="Findings" />
<img src="./images/class_sur.png" alt="Embarked Proportion" title="Findings" />
<img src="./images/sex_sur.png" alt="Embarked Proportion" title="Findings" />
<img src="./images/embarked_sur.png" alt="Embarked Proportion" title="Findings" /></p>
<h3>Risks and Assumptions</h3>

<p>Risks:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have no information about who created this dataset or where it came from</li>
<li>The proportion of survival and no survival is slightly different form the real numbers</li>
<li>For approximately 20% of the passengers, age was missing.</li>
<li>Only 33 % of the of the passengers have cabin’s location information.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assumptions:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>This data is 80% reliable and represents the behavior of the population.</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Model</h3>

<p>We used logistic and KNN models for this prediction of "survival or "no survival" 
We trained and tested on a hold-out sample (30% of the dataset). Each model used the following features from the data:</p>
<p> <b>dummy variables for Sex, Class, SibSp, and Parch </b> </p>

<p> <b>normalized Age and Fare </b> </p>

<p> <b>The ROC:0.85249383906568088</b> </p>

<h3>Results </h3>

<h4>Correlation of the coeficients</h4>

<p><img src="./images/coefs_titanic.jpg" alt="Embarked Proportion" title="Findings" /></p>
<h4>ROC curve For the Logistic Regression model </h4>

<p><img src="./images/ROC_logreg.png" alt="Embarked Proportion" title="Findings" /></p>
<h4>Comparision of the ROC curve for the logistic regression and Knn models </h4>

<p><img src="./images/ROC_comp_logreg_knn.png" alt="Embarked Proportion" title="Findings" /></p>
<p>Confusion Table</p>

<p><img src="./images/confusion_logreg.jpg" alt="Embarked Proportion" title="Findings" /></p>
<p>Confusion matrix tells us that the model correctly predicted 81 survivors and 165 non-survivors, 17 were predicted to survive actually died(Type 1 error or false positives), while 31 were predicted died and actually survived (type 2 error or false negative).</p>
<p>Classification Report</p>

<p>Logistic Regression Model</p>

<p><img src="./images/classifi_logreg.jpg" alt="Embarked Proportion" title="Findings" /></p>
<p>Recall is about 0.84. This is the sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR)
The model was able to predict 83% of all survived passengers.
Precision is about 0.84. This is a measure of TP / (TP + FP).
F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity, provides and aggregated view of both performance metrics.</p>

<p>Knn Model</p>

<p><img src="./images/classification_knn_model.jpg" alt="Embarked Proportion" title="Findings" /></p>
<p>Both models performed fairly similarly. </p>
<p>It was a very good experience to use different classifying model in order to tune the model.</p>
